• Time-series data persistence with 30-day retention
• Auto-provisioned Grafana dashboards and datasources
• Production-ready metrics server with Prometheus endpoints

🔧 INFRASTRUCTURE:
• Docker Compose monitoring stack with health checks
• Production alert rules for service health, memory, performance
• Automated startup scripts and documentation
• Grafana dashboard provisioning and configuration

📊 METRICS MIGRATION:
• StreamingMetricsCollector: Micrometer-based production metrics
• ProductionMetricsServer: Replaces custom dashboard HTTP server

• Basic HTML UI → Professional Grafana dashboards  
• In-memory metrics → Persistent time-series database
• Manual alerts → Sophisticated alert management
• Single service → Multi-service scalability
• Custom format → Industry standard Prometheus

🎯 PRODUCTION READY:
• All builds passing with updated dependencies
• Monitoring stack health-checked and validated
• Enterprise-grade observability with metrics, alerting
• Documentation and startup scripts included
• Backward compatibility maintained during migration

Files changed:
